# Setting Up Your Account

When you first try to use a command, you may notice something similar to the following message:&#x20;

> You must **create an account** before you can use this command!&#x20;

This means you have not yet set up your account. You can do this using the **/account create** command.

### The Account Create Command

When you use this command, the bot will immediately start the account creation process, unless you already are logged into an account, in which you will get a message saying so.

These are the questions you will be asked:
