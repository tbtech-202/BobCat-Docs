# FAQ

### Why does the bot want so much of my information?

We ask for all of this information when creating so people can get to know you. We do  not sell this information or use it maliciously, these options are just for show. If you don't feel safe giving us information, the option to skip is always there.

### Why aren't there many questions in your FAQ?

That's easy - it's because the bot is small there aren't any questions that are asked frequently, therefore we cannot answer them.
